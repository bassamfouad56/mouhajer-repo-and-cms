# Network Error Fix - Room Redesign API

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Error Message:**
```
Network error. Please check your connection and try again.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `/api/room-redesign/upload` endpoint was missing, causing the fetch request from the room-redesign page to fail.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Created API Endpoint

**File:** `apps/frontend/app/api/room-redesign/upload/route.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ File upload validation (image type, size limit 10MB)
- ✅ Firebase Storage integration
- ✅ Email notifications (admin + client)
- ✅ Tracking ID generation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Graceful degradation (works even if Firebase or email fails)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Form Submission Flow

```
User fills form → Uploads image → Clicks "Generate My Redesign"
         ↓
POST /api/room-redesign/upload
         ↓
Validation (file type, size, email)
         ↓
Upload to Firebase Storage
         ↓
Send email notifications
         ↓
Return success response
```

### 2. Request Payload

The API accepts:
- `image` (File) - Room photo
- `email` (string) - User's email
- `style` (string) - Design style (modern, minimalist, etc.)
- `roomType` (string) - Room type (living_room, bedroom, etc.)
- `prompt` (string, optional) - Additional instructions

### 3. Response Handling

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Your request has been submitted successfully",
  "trackingId": "uuid-v4",
  "imageUploaded": true
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error message here",
  "details": "Optional details"
}
```

## Email Notifications

### Admin Email
- Sent to: `supply@mouhajerdesign.com`
- Contains: Tracking ID, user email, room details, image link
- Subject: "New Room Redesign Request"

### Client Email
- Sent to: User's email
- Contains: Confirmation, tracking ID, what happens next
- Subject: "We Received Your Room Redesign Request!"
- Includes timeline expectations (2-5 minutes)

---

## Firebase Storage Structure

Images are uploaded to:
```
room-redesign/
  └── {timestamp}-{uuid}.{ext}
```

**Metadata includes:**
- `email` - User's email
- `style` - Selected design style
- `roomType` - Selected room type
- `prompt` - Additional instructions
- `uploadedAt` - ISO timestamp

---

## Error Handling

The API handles multiple failure scenarios gracefully:

1. **Missing Fields**
   - Returns 400 with specific error message

2. **Invalid File Type**
   - Returns 400: "Please upload a valid image file"

3. **File Too Large**
   - Returns 400: "Image size must be less than 10MB"

4. **Firebase Upload Fails**
   - Still sends email notification
   - Warns admin that image upload failed

5. **Email Send Fails**
   - Still returns success if image uploaded
   - Includes warning in response

6. **Complete Failure**
   - Returns 500 with error details
   - Logs error to console

---

## Environment Variables Required

The API requires these environment variables to be set in `.env.local`:

```env
# Email Configuration
NEXT_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_zoho_email_password

# Firebase Configuration (optional, for image upload)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}
```

**Note:** The API will work without Firebase (skips image upload) but requires email credentials.

---

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the Development Server

The server is already running on port 3007.

### 2. Visit the Room Redesign Page

```
http://localhost:3007/en/room-redesign
```

### 3. Test the Form

1. Upload an image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP, max 10MB)
2. Select room type (e.g., Living Room)
3. Choose design style (e.g., Modern)
4. Add optional instructions
5. Enter email address
6. Click "Generate My Redesign"

### 4. Expected Behavior

**Before the fix:**
- ❌ Network error immediately
- ❌ No request sent to server

**After the fix:**
- ✅ Loading spinner appears
- ✅ Request sent to `/api/room-redesign/upload`
- ✅ Success screen with confirmation
- ✅ Email sent to user
- ✅ Email sent to admin

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. AI Integration

The current API collects the data but doesn't generate the redesign. To complete the workflow:

```typescript
// After image upload, call AI service
const redesignResult = await generateRoomRedesign({
  imageUrl,
  style,
  roomType,
  prompt
});

// Store result in database
await storeRedesignResult({
  trackingId,
  originalImage: imageUrl,
  redesignedImage: redesignResult.url,
  email
});

// Update email with result link
```

### 2. Database Integration

Store redesign requests in a database:

```typescript
// PostgreSQL/MongoDB schema
{
  trackingId: string,
  email: string,
  originalImageUrl: string,
  redesignedImageUrl: string,
  style: string,
  roomType: string,
  prompt: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  createdAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date
}
```

### 3. Result Viewing Page

Create `/room-redesign/view/[trackingId]` to display:
- Original image
- Redesigned image
- Before/after slider
- Download options

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Email not sent" Error

**Cause:** Email credentials not configured or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_EMAIL_PASSWORD`
2. Verify Zoho email credentials
3. Check email service is active

### "Image upload failed" Warning

**Cause:** Firebase not configured or credentials invalid

**Impact:** Minimal - email is still sent, just without image

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
2. Verify Firebase credentials are valid
3. Ensure storage bucket exists

### Still Getting Network Error

**Cause:** Server not reloaded after adding the API route

**Fix:**
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart: `npm run dev:frontend`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try again
