# Frontend Test Results

## Current Status:
- ✅ Frontend server is running on port 3007
- ✅ CMS server is running on port 3010
- ❌ Frontend showing 500 error on http://localhost:3007/en

## Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Created simple homepage without CMS dependencies
2. ✅ Created simple layout without navigation fetching
3. ✅ Updated package.json to use port 3007
4. ✅ Fixed environment variables

## Next Steps:
1. Restart the frontend server to pick up changes
2. Test the basic homepage
3. Gradually add CMS integration back

## Commands to Run:
```bash
# Kill existing servers
npx kill-port 3007 3010

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## Test URLs:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3007/en
- Frontend Arabic: http://localhost:3007/ar
- CMS: http://localhost:3010

The 500 error should now be resolved with the simplified homepage and layout.
