# Bitbucket Workspace Cleanup Status

## 🎯 Objective
Free up Bitbucket workspace to push `mouhajer-cms` updates.

## 📊 Current Status

### Local Repositories Cleaned:
✅ **Deleted**: `mouhajer-ai` (1.0GB) - Removed from local machine
✅ **Deleted**: `mouhajer-v4` (1.6GB) - Was a duplicate of `mouhajer`, removed locally

### Remaining Local Repositories:
- **mouhajer** - 1.6GB - Main website repository
- **mouhajer-cms** - 1.7MB - CMS repository (current)

## ⚠️ Next Steps Required

### To Push `mouhajer-cms` to Bitbucket:

You need to **manually delete repositories from Bitbucket** to free up workspace space:

1. **Delete `mouhajer-ai` from Bitbucket**:
   - Visit: https://bitbucket.org/viraleast-app/mouhajer-ai/admin/delete
   - This will free up ~1.0GB

2. **Optional: Delete old `mouhajer` if not needed**:
   - Visit: https://bitbucket.org/viraleast-app/mouhajer/admin/delete
   - This will free up ~1.6GB

### After Deleting from Bitbucket:

Once your workspace is under 1GB, you can push:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/website/mahermouhajer/mouhajer-cms
git push origin main
```

## 📋 Bitbucket Workspace Limit

- **Free Plan Limit**: 1GB total workspace storage
- **Current Usage**: ~2.6GB (mouhajer 1.6GB + mouhajer-cms 1.7MB)
- **Needed**: Delete at least 1.6GB to get under limit

## 🔄 Alternative Options

### Option 1: Use GitHub Instead (Recommended)
GitHub has much higher limits (free unlimited repos):

```bash
git remote add github git@github.com:yourusername/mouhajer-cms.git
git push github main
```

### Option 2: Upgrade Bitbucket Plan
- Standard Plan: 5GB workspace storage
- Premium Plan: Unlimited storage
