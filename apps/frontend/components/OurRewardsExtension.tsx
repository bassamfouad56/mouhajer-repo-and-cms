          The Sheraton Abu Dhabi has gone through an extensive renovation of the
          rooms, lobby, and recreational facilities, including the health club
          and spa and selected food and beverage venues, all under the watchful
          eye of Mouhajer International Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fusion of old-world charm and modern culture makes the hotel a place
          where guests will feel at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design combines timelessness with a renewed and up-to-date feel,
          creating a setting where visitors feel relaxed and at ease whether for
          relaxing, meeting or working.
